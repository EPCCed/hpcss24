## Overview

The morning lectures will all have associated practicals. You are
welcome to continue working on these in the afternoons, but in case
you want to explore things a bit more you can work on applying the
morning's HPC techniques to two examples: one based on image
processing, the other a simple computational fluid dynamics example.

## Material

### Monday AM

We will use Carpentries material for this session. See:

  * HPC Carpentry Day 1 https://epcced.github.io/2024-06-19-hpc-shell-shampton/
  * Introduction to git https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/

The HPC Carpentry material was run by EPCC very recently for a course
on the national ARCHER2 supercomputer. We will be using a different
HPC system at EPCC, Cirrus, but all you have to do is replace
occurrences of "ARCHER2" with "Cirrus"!

### Monday PM

Here is the [claims form](docs/student_and_non_staff_expenses_claim_form.docx)

You can find the image sharpening example at
https://github.com/EPCCed/hpcss24-sharpen

I will explain this program and how it works on Wednesday but for now
we'll just be using the Python serial version in the `P-SER` directory
as an example of a program that does lots of computation.

On Cirrus you will need to load a module to get a suitable version of Python: `module load python/3.9.13`

To view the input and output images (`fuzzy.pgm` and `sharpened.pgm`),
use `module load ImageMagick` then `display image.pgm`.

Things you might like to investigate:

  * How fast is the code on your laptop compared to the Cirrus login nodes?

  * If you want the program to run faster you can change the size of
  the smoothing filter - try reducing the value of `d` in
  `sharpenalg.py` from its default value `d=8`. How does the runtime
  vary with `d`? Can you understand this behaviour by looking at the
  code?

  * The program is deliberately written very simply and the
    performance can easily be improved. For example, the values of the
    (very time-consuming) function `filter()` could be pre-calculate
    and stored in an array. If you do alter the code make sure that
    the output is still correct, e.g. by comparing the output image
    `sharpened.pgm`.

### Tuesday AM

  Ludovic will distribute his slides covering an Introduction to C

### Tuesday PM

  As well as the pagerank example, you can look at the C version of
  the Image Sharpening code in `C-SER`.

  The exercise is described in `doc/sharpen-cirrus1.pdf` - the
  material up to and including section 3.8 is relevant here.

  Things to look at include:

  * How much faster is the compiled C version compared to the Python code?
  * Does adding compiler optimisation (e.g. `-O3`) change the performance?
  * Does using the GNU compiler `gcc`, as opposed to Intel's `icc`,
    change things?

### Wednesday AM

  * Go to https://b.socrative.com/login/student/
  * "Room" is HPCQUIZ

  Here are the slides for the Introduction to HPC:

  * [Why HPC](slides/L01_WhyHPC.pdf)
  * [Image Sharpening](slides/L02_Sharpen.pdf)
  * [Parallel Programming](slides/L03_ParallelProgramming.pdf)
  * [Hardware](slides/L04_CPUMemAcc.pdf)
  * [Parallel Programming Models](slides/L07_ParallelModels.pdf)


  You should work through the Image Sharpening worksheet and look at
  the performance and parallel scalability of the code.

  To see the code and exercise sheets, go to [https://github.com/EPCCed/hpcss24-sharpen](https://github.com/EPCCed/hpcss24-sharpen)

  To get these onto Cirrus just use:

    git clone https://github.com/EPCCed/hpcss24-sharpen

We have a reservation of 8 nodes for fast turnaround all day today. To use this:

````
    #SBATCH --qos=reservation
    #SBATCH --reservation=tc063_Q2482854
````
    

### Wednesday PM

 There are also OpenMP and (serial) Python versions that you could look at.

   * How does the scalability of the OpenMP code (using threads not processes) compare to MPI?
   * How does using OpenMP limit the ultimate speed of the program compare to MPI?

### Thursday AM

  Ludovic will distribute his slides covering an Introduction to OpenMP

### Thursday PM

  You are welcome to continue with Ludovic's OpenMP
  exercises. However, if you want to tackle something different see
  below:

  You should work through the CFD worksheet and look at the
  performance and parallel scalability of the code.

  To see the code and exercise sheets, go to [https://github.com/EPCCed/hpcss24-cfd](https://github.com/EPCCed/hpcss24-cfd)

  To get these onto Cirrus just use:

    git clone https://github.com/EPCCed/hpcss24-cfd

  The exercise sheet only covers the serial and MPI versions of the
  cfd example. Here are some things you could consider with the serial
  Python and parallel OpenMP versions. When compiling code I would
  recommend using the `-O3` optimisation level.


  * Visualising the Python output requires you to run an additional
    program: ` python ./plot_flow.py velocity.dat colourmap.dat
    output.png`. You can then view the PNG file with `display`.
  * How long does the Python code take compared to the serial C code
    (consider a small example for a reasonable runtime)?
* Is the performance different on the login vs compute nodes (you will
    need to write an appropriate Slurm script). What about the serial
    C code?
* There is a version that uses numpy arrays and array syntax rather
    than lists and explicit loops - see `cfd_numpy` and
    `jacobi_numpy`. How much faster is this than the basic Python
    code? Do you understand why? Again, is there a performance difference between login and compute nodes?

* Try running the OpenMP code - how does its performance scale with
  varying values of `OMP_NUM_THREADS`. For large values you must run
  on the compute nodes - again, you will need to write a Slurm
  script. How does this compare to MPI? Do you seen any unusual
  effects when the thread count exceeds 18 - can you explain this?

* How does the OpenMP performance scaling compare between the default
  parameters and running with a finite value of the Reynolds number,
  e.g. 2.0? Can you see what the problem is? Can you fix it by adding
  appropriate OpenMP directives?

### Friday AM

  Ludovic will continue his OpenMP workshop

### Friday PM

  The way that `dosharpen` is parallelised in OpenMP is a bit weird - it is done by hand and does not use `parallel for`.

  Rewrite the code so it uses `parallel for` over the first loop
  rather than switching based on the value of `pixcount`. Is the
  performance similar to the original version? What loop schedule
  should you use - does it make a difference to performance?

  [Here is a version of `dosharpen`](docs/dosharpen.c) written
  deliberately to have load imbalance within the main loop (the width
  of the filter is varied across the image from `2` to `d`). As
  above, rewrite the code to use `parallel for`. Does the loop
  schedule affect performance for the load-imbalanced sharpening
  algorithm?  What is the best schedule - `static`, `dynamic`. ... ?

### Monday AM

  Ludovic will distribute slide for his OpenMP GPU offload workshop

### Monday PM

  There is a lot to learn for GPU offload so please continue with
  exercises from this morning, but I have added a "C-GPU" directory to
  the hpcss24-cfd git repo which contains a simple example of using
  these directives for the cfd example.

  As for the previous OpenMP example the code only currently works for
  the simpler case when you do not specify a Reynolds number (i.e. for
  inviscid / irrotational flow). If you want you can try to extend to
  the general case.

  When measuring performance you will need to run much larger problems
  than for the CPU as you need a lot of grid points to keep the very
  large number of GPU threads active. You will also need to run for a
  large number of iterations to get reliable performance results: for
  large problems the cost of copying data to and from the GPU can be
  significant.

  The reservation for today is `tc063_1270277`

### Tuesday AM

  Ludovic will conclude his GPU offload lectures.

### Tuesday PM

  As ever, continue working on this morning's material if you
  want. However, feel free to look at the CFD example (described
  above).  The reservation for today is `tc063_1270283`

### Wednesday AM

  Ludovic will introduce MPI

### Wednesday PM

  If you have finished this morning's exercises, there are exercises
  from a recent ARCHER2 MPI course that you can look at - see https://github.com/EPCCed/archer2-MPI-2024-04-03#Exercise-Material

  See the "MPI exercise sheet". If you want to take a peek, solutions
  are available in "Detailed solutions to pi calculation example" and
  "Simple example solutions to all exercises"

  If you want to investigate a larger code rather than bite-sized
  examples, take a look at the MPI CFD example and check you
  understand how it works.

  In particular, look at the way that the boundary information is
  exchanged using `MPI_Sendrecv`. This routine combines both send and
  receive calls into a single function to help avoid deadlock. Find
  out how the function works (google is your friend) and see if you
  can replace it with separate send and receive functions.

  If you are brave, try versions using `MPI_Send` and `MPI_Ssend`. Do
  they both run correctly? How does the performance compare between
  the two versions when you run on multiple nodes, say 128 processes?
  Do you understand why this is? How does the performance of
  `MPI_Bsend` compare?

  For these tests it is best to use relatively small simulation sizes
  but run for many iterations (to keep the runtime at several
  seconds). Although this might not give you very good parallel
  efficiency, it does magnify the effects of the time spent in MPI
  routines. This is useful when you're interesting in MPI efficiency
  as opposed to overall performance including both communication and
  calculation.

  You should **always** check that your code is correct. The easiest
  test is that the `error` value printed at the end is the same.

### Thursday  AM

  David will conclude the MPI material. I will finish by 12:30 at the
  very latest to give you time for lunch before the ACF tour this
  afternoon.

### Thursday PM

  We will heading out to the [Advanced Computing Facility](https://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/hpc-services/advanced-computing-facility). The ACF Building is about 10km south of the Bayes Centre - see [google maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/ACF+Building/@55.855546,-3.2347334,14z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1sacf+computer+centre!3m6!1s0x4887c0f3885f5f89:0xda060412b31a29b!8m2!3d55.855546!4d-3.1997145!15sChNhY2YgY29tcHV0ZXIgY2VudHJlkgEVdW5pdmVyc2l0eV9kZXBhcnRtZW504AEA!16s%2Fg%2F11byyg8n5q?entry=ttu).

### Friday PM

You can carry on with the MPI exercises if you want.

You should now know enough to understand the whole of the CFD code
including data distribution and collection (MPI scatter and gather),
and the way that the error value is accumulated across processes (MPI
reduction operation).

If you're looking for a challenge, try using non-blocking
communications for the halo swapping. This can be done in several ways
including:

  * Non-blocking send, blocking receive and wait.
  * Non-blocking receive, blocking send and wait.
  * Non-blocking send, non-blocking receive and waitall.
