## Overview

The morning lectures will all have associated practicals. You are
welcome to continue working on these in the afternoons, but in case
you want to explore thinsg a bit more you can work on applying the
morning's HCC techniques to two examples: one based on image
processing, the other a simple computational fluid dynamics example.
